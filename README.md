# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

##  Data 

The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

## data process
The Data Set has been stored in UCI HAR Dataset/ directory.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work. It can be loaded in R/Rstudio and executed without any parameters.



The result of the execution is that a tidy.csv file is being created, that stores the data (mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity&subject) for later analysis.
